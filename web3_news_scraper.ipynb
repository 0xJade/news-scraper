The research will focus on understanding how users currently interact with Ethereum-based applications, identifying pain points in the journey toward \"seamless, secure and permissionless experience,\" and providing actionable insights to guide UX improvements.\\n\\n## Research Objectives\\n\\n### Primary Objectives\\n1. **Map the current user journey** across Ethereum applications and identify friction points\\n2. **Understand user mental models** of blockchain interactions, security, and permissionless systems\\n3. **Identify barriers to adoption** that prevent mainstream users from engaging with Ethereum\\n4. **Evaluate current solutions** and their effectiveness in addressing UX challenges\\n\\n### Secondary Objectives\\n1. Benchmark user expectations against current Ethereum UX capabilities\\n2. Understand how users perceive and manage security vs. usability trade-offs\\n3. Identify opportunities for seamless cross-application experiences\\n4. Generate user personas and journey maps specific to Ethereum ecosystem\\n\\n## Research Questions\\n\\n### Core Questions\\n- What does \"seamless\" mean to users in the context of blockchain interactions?\\n- How do users currently understand and manage security in decentralized applications?\\n- What are the primary barriers preventing users from adopting Ethereum-based solutions?\\n- How do users expect permissionless systems to work, and where do current implementations fall short?\\n\\n### Detailed Questions\\n- What are users\\' biggest frustrations with current wallet experiences?\\n- How do users perceive transaction fees, speeds, and confirmation processes?\\n- What level of technical understanding do users expect to need vs. what they actually need?\\n- How do users discover, evaluate, and trust new dApps?\\n\\n## Proposed Research Methodology\\n\\n### Phase 1: Foundational Research (4 weeks)\\n**User Interviews (n=20)**\\n- Semi-structured interviews with current Ethereum users across experience levels\\n- Focus on journey mapping and pain point identification\\n- Segments: New users (0-6 months), Intermediate users (6-24 months), Advanced users (2+ years)\\n\\n**Expert Interviews (n=8)**\\n- UX designers, developers, and product managers in the Ethereum ecosystem\\n- Understanding of technical constraints and current solution approaches\\n\\n### Phase 2: Behavioral Analysis (3 weeks)\\n**Usability Testing (n=15)**\\n- Task-based testing of common Ethereum interactions (wallet setup, dApp usage, transactions)\\n- Think-aloud protocols to understand mental models\\n- Testing across different user interfaces and wallet solutions\\n\\n**Diary Studies (n=12)**\\n- 1-week longitudinal study of actual Ethereum usage\\n- Understanding context of use and real-world friction points\\n\\n### Phase 3: Broader Validation (2 weeks)\\n**Survey Research (n=300)**\\n- Quantitative validation of qualitative findings\\n- Broader sample including non-users to understand adoption barriers\\n- Statistical analysis of UX priorities and preferences\\n\\n## Target Participants\\n\\n### Primary Segments\\n1. **Current Ethereum Users**\\n   - New users (0-6 months experience)\\n   - Intermediate users (6-24 months experience)  \\n   - Advanced users (2+ years experience)\\n\\n2. **Potential Users**\\n   - Crypto-curious individuals who haven\\'t used Ethereum\\n   - Traditional fintech users\\n   - Web3-adjacent users (NFT buyers, etc.)\\n\\n3. **Professional Stakeholders**\\n   - dApp developers and designers\\n   - Wallet providers\\n   - Infrastructure teams\\n\\n### Recruitment Criteria\\n- Geographic diversity (North America, Europe, Asia)\\n- Demographic diversity (age, technical background, use cases)\\n- Range of technical sophistication levels\\n- Various interaction frequencies and use cases\\n\\n## Key Deliverables\\n\\n### Research Outputs\\n1. **Comprehensive Research Report** (40-50 pages)\\n   - Executive summary with key findings\\n   - Detailed analysis of user pain points and opportunities\\n   - Comparative analysis of current solutions\\n\\n2. **User Persona Suite** (5-7 personas)\\n   - Detailed personas representing key user segments\\n   - Goals, frustrations, and behavioral patterns\\n   - UX priorities and technical comfort levels\\n\\n3. **User Journey Maps**\\n   - End-to-end journey maps for key user scenarios\\n   - Identification'"
